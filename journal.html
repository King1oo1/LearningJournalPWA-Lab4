                <h3>Which DOM selection methods did you use, and why did you choose them?</h3>
                <p>I used getElementById() for single things like the live date and theme toggle because it is fast and accurate. Because of its flexibility and ability to accept CSS selectors, I used querySelectorAll() for several objects, including collapsable sections.</p>
                
                <h3>What was the most challenging part about linking JavaScript with your HTML?</h3>
                <p>The most difficult aspect was making sure that the JavaScript loaded at the right moment and that all DOM elements were available when the scripts tried to access them. The use of the DOMContentLoaded event solves the time issue.</p>
                
                <h3>How did you test and debug your JavaScript code?</h3>
                <p>I used browser developer tools extensively, such as console.log for debugging data, the Elements tab for checking DOM structure, and testing all interactive features on different screen sizes to ensure responsiveness.</p>

                <h3>Mobile-First Design Approach</h3>
                <p>I began by designing with mobile devices in mind, utilising a layout with one column that eventually expands on larger screens. This method ensured that the essential content and functionality worked flawlessly on reduced viewports.</p>
                
                <h3>Most Useful HTML/CSS Concept</h3>
                <p>The CSS Flexbox concept was the most helpful one I used to create responsive layout structures and navigation. With Flexbox, creating flexible components that adjust to various screen sizes without requiring intricate computations was simple.</p>
                
                <h3>Most Challenging Aspect</h3>
                <p>The hardest things for me were choosing a breakpoint and media queries. To enable smooth transitions between layouts, the ideal breakpoints for various devices needed to be tested and adjusted.</p>
